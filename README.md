# E20 Processor Simulator
This project simulates the E20 processor.
It takes the machine code generated with the [translator](https://github.com/abeeds/E20-Instruction-Translator) and runs it, replicating the behavior expected from the processor.<br>
To run this program use this command `gcc -o sim.cpp FILE_NAME`.
